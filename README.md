## Technologies Used

### Flutter

Flutter is utilized for building the user interface and managing the app's logic. With its cross-platform capabilities and extensive widget library, Flutter enables the creation of visually appealing and responsive user interfaces.

### Dart

Dart serves as the primary programming language for Flutter app development. Its simplicity and efficiency make it well-suited for building robust mobile applications.

### Shared Preferences

For basic local storage requirements, the app utilizes Flutter's shared preferences plugin. This allows tasks to be persisted locally on the device, ensuring that they remain accessible even when the app is closed or reopened.

### SQLite Database

For more advanced local storage and management of tasks, the app integrates SQLite database functionality. SQLite provides a lightweight, yet powerful solution for storing structured data, enabling efficient querying and manipulation of tasks.
